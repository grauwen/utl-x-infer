# `validate.*` — Naming Convention & the Guard Profile

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Document | utlx-validate-naming-and-guard-profile |
| Repo | `github.com/grauwen/utl-x-infer` |
| Status | Accepted — reconciliation of `validate.*` across the 1.1 spec and the MIL books |
| Depends on | `utlx-1_1-semantic-validation.md` (the 1.1 `validate.*` namespace) |
| Related | `utlx-mil/docs/guard-rule-library.md` (the guard profile source); MIL books _The Content Guard_, _The Mapper_ |

> **One line.** The canonical `validate.*` style is **descriptive, camelCase** (`validate.inRange`,
> not `validate.range`). The namespace has two tiers: a **core set** every edition carries, and a
> **guard profile** — a structural/allow-list extension used by the content guard — defined in
> `guard-rule-library.md`. This doc records the convention, the rename that aligned the 1.1 spec and
> the Mapper book to it, and the full vocabulary table.

---

## 1. Decision

1. **Convention: descriptive, camelCase.** A call site should read as intent
   (`validate.inRange(lat, -90, 90)`), which matters most for the guard's reviewers and
   accreditors. Terse (`range`) and snake_case (`iso_date`) names are rejected.
2. **The guard's vocabulary is the model.** The content guard is the most demanding consumer, so its
   names (already descriptive) set the standard; the 1.1 spec and the Mapper book were brought up to
   it, not the other way round.
3. **Two tiers, one namespace.** Tier 1 (core) ships in every edition. Tier 2 (guard profile) is a
   structural/allow-list extension — the caps and allow-list functions that only a guard needs —
   defined in `guard-rule-library.md`. Tier 2 is not required of a non-guard engine.

## 2. Rename applied (terse/snake_case → canonical)

| Was (1.1 spec draft) | Now (canonical) | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `validate.range` | **`validate.inRange`** | descriptive; guard already used it |
| `validate.codelist` | **`validate.oneOf`** | descriptive; guard already used it |
| `validate.iso_date` | **`validate.isoDate`** | camelCase |
| `validate.mutually_exclusive` | **`validate.mutuallyExclusive`** | camelCase |
| `validate.at_least_one` | **`validate.atLeastOne`** | camelCase |

Applied in: `utlx-1_1-semantic-validation.md` (§5.3–5.9 and examples) and the Mapper book
(`07-military-grade-validation.typ`, `appendix-a-quick-reference.typ`). The Guard book needed no
change — it was already the model.

## 3. Tier 1 — core validation (every edition)

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `validate.assert(rules)` | general form: named rules, each a condition + message (+ field, severity) |
| `validate.required(fields)` | named fields must be present |
| `validate.inRange(field, min, max)` | numeric field within bounds |
| `validate.oneOf(field, values)` | field is one of an allowed set (enum / releasability) |
| `validate.matches(field, pattern)` | field matches a regular expression |
| `validate.isoDate(field, format)` | field is a well-formed date-time |
| `validate.unique(arrayField, keyField)` | no duplicate keys in a collection |
| `validate.mutuallyExclusive(fields)` | at most one of a set is present |
| `validate.atLeastOne(fields)` | at least one of a set is present |

All Tier 1 functions return a `ValidationResult`, chain with `|>`, and keep every 1.0 guarantee
(pure, stateless, deterministic, single-pass). See `utlx-1_1-semantic-validation.md`.

## 4. Tier 2 — guard profile (structural / allow-list extension)

Defined in `utlx-mil/docs/guard-rule-library.md`. These enforce the guard's allow-list and
anti-bomb posture and have no equivalent in the base spec, so they keep their own descriptive names.

| Function | Category |
|---|---|
| `validate.conformsTo(node, contract)` | schema allow-list |
| `validate.onlyFields(node, fields)` | field allow-list |
| `validate.noAdditionalProperties(node)` | field allow-list |
| `validate.maxDepth(node, n)` | structural cap |
| `validate.maxBytes(node, n)` | structural cap |
| `validate.maxNodes(node, n)` | structural cap |
| `validate.maxStringLength(node, n)` | structural cap |
| `validate.maxArrayLength(node, n)` | structural cap |
| `validate.noControlChars(field)` | keyword / dirty-word |
| `validate.noEmbeddedMarkup(field)` | keyword / dirty-word |
| `validate.noneMatch(field, patterns)` | keyword / dirty-word |
| `validate.absent(fields)` | field allow-list (negative) |
| `validate.impliesPresent(a, b)` | cross-field semantics |
| `validate.isFinite(field)` | value constraint |
| `validate.all(results)` | combinator — merge many results into one `ValidationResult` |

## 5. Rationale

- **Readability at the call site** is the deciding factor; the guard's audience (reviewers,
  accreditors) reads the rules as documentation.
- **The hardest consumer sets the vocabulary**, so the reference case is the demanding one.
- **No loss of power**: the structural caps that only a guard needs live in a named profile rather
  than being forced into, or omitted from, the base spec.

## 6. Open questions

- Should Tier 2 eventually be promoted into the base spec as an optional "structural" module, or stay
  guard-owned in `guard-rule-library.md`? (Kept guard-owned for now.)
- A schema-ref variant of `validate.oneOf` (list sourced from a contract enum rather than inline) —
  tracked in `utlx-1_1-semantic-validation.md` §11.
- Conformance: one behaviour suite that both the engine (Tier 1) and the guard edition (Tier 1 + 2)
  must pass, proving parity of names and semantics.
